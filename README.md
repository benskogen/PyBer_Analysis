# PyBer_Analysis

Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to make inferences upon the regional ride-sharing data of PyBer, to determine better ways to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of the service, as well as to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data upon city-types.

In the dataset provided, we were able to find that in Urban areas, there is a higher demand for ride-sharing than there is in the other city-types, with a total of 1625 rides given and 2405 available drivers.  For suburban and rural areas, there were 625 rides given with 490 drivers, and 125 rides with 78 drivers, respectively.  From rural to suburban to urban environments, there is an increasing ratio of drivers to rides.

according to the dataset, there are more rides taken than there are drivers in both rural and suburban areas.  This is opposed to urban city areas, where there appears to be exactly 48% more available drivers than there are rides taken.  This is good news for the riders, as the high availability of drivers makes it much easier to hail a ride.  However, with too many drivers per customers, many drivers will see little to zero rides on a given day.  By looking at the data, one may infer that more drivers are concentrated in the urban areas due to higher demand for rides.  It may be more beneficial to spread a portion of urban drivers outward, where riders aren't discouraged by the lack of available drivers.

Summary

By first glancing at the line graph and summary chart, one can see that Urban areas contain the most rides and largest cumulative fares received.  While it may look like the most profitable area, one must consider that of the 2405 available drivers, there were only 1625 rides taken.  My recommendation for the CEO would be to re-distribute a portion urban drivers to both suburban and rural areas where there are less drivers available in order to provide better service for those seeking rides, where the profit margin is higher. This could be done on a rotational basis to keep things fair for the drivers.

Continuing off of that point, another reccomendation would be to re-locate drivers from the city to the rural and suburban areas during peak travel times.  The line chart shows one notable sharp peak for the rural/suburban fares, which could be attributed to customers hailing rides to the airport. The last week or two of February is a common time for spring break and spring vacations, so if they can understand when people are traveling to the airport, they can leverage more rides and therefore profits this way.

Also, a good strategy would be to realize when people are traveling home from the airport.  A week or two following the peak vacation time, it would pay off to staff drivers in urban areas near the airport, so they can provide high fare rides for travelers back to their homes in rural and suburban areas.
